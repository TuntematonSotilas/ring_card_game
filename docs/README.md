## How the docs are organised

- **[functional/](functional/)** — *what* the game is: rules, cards, modes, UX. Written for designers and anyone joining the project. No code.
- **[technical/](technical/)** — *how* it is built: architecture, data model, engine, build. Each file links back to the functional section it implements.
- **[adr/](adr/)** — Architecture Decision Records: one file per significant, hard-to-reverse decision.
- **[tools/](tools/README.md)** — recommended software for producing art and audio.

Pending decisions are written as `> **Open question:** …` in every file. List them all with:

```sh
grep -rn "Open question" docs/
```

## Document conventions

- Header block on every file: title, one-line purpose, `Status` (Draft / Review / Stable), last-updated date.
- Functional docs describe behaviour only; technical docs reference them with relative links.
- Diagrams use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) (rendered by GitHub and the VS Code Markdown preview with a Mermaid extension).
- When a decision is made, replace the `Open question` block with `> **Decision (YYYY-MM-DD):** …`; record it as an ADR if it is architectural. List decisions with `grep -rn "Decision (" docs/`.
